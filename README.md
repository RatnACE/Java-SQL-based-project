# Java-SQL-based-project
1. Introduction
This software project is developed to automate the functionalities of a spots shop.The purpose of the software project is to develop the Management Information System (MIS) to automate the record keeping of customer entry,order entry and item entry  with a view to enhance the decision making  of the functionaries. 
 A MIS mainly consists of a computerized database, a collection of inter-related tables for a particular subject or purpose, capable to produce different reports relevant to the user. An application program is tied with the database for easy access and interface to the database. Using Application program or front-end, we can store, retrieve and manage all information in proper way. 
This software, being simple in design and working, does not require much of training to users, and can be used as a powerful tool for automating a sports shop System.
During coding and design of the software Project, Java NetBeans IDE, a powerful front-end tool is used for getting Graphical User Interface (GUI) based integrated platform and coding simplicity. As a back-end a powerful, open source RDBMS, My SQL is used as per requirement of the CBSE curriculum of Informatics Practices Course. 

2. Objective & Scope of the Project 
T
he objective of the software project is to develop a computerized MIS to automate the functions of a spots shop This software project is also aimed to enhance the current record keeping system, which will help managers to retrieve the up-to-date information at right time in right shape.
The proposed software system is expected to do the following functionality-
	To provide a user friendly, Graphical User Interface (GUI) based integrated and centralized environment for MIS activities.  
	The proposed system should maintain all the records and transactions, and should generate the required reports and information when required.
	To provide graphical and user-friendly interface to interact with a centralized database based on client-server architecture.
	To identify the critical operation procedure and possibilities of simplification using modern IT tools and practices.
In its current scope, the software enables user to retrieve and update the information from centralized database designed with MySQL . This software does not require much training time of the users due to limited functionality and simplicity.
During the development of  sports shop Information System  project, Java NetBeans IDE, a powerful, open source event-driven form-based development environment is used for modular design and future expandability of the system.
Despite of the best effort of the developer, the following limitations and functional boundaries are visible, which limits the scope of this application software.
1.	This software can store records and produce reports in pre-designed format in soft copy. There is no facility yet to produce customized reports. Only specified reports are covered. 
2.	There is no provision to calculate fine or penalty etc. for defaulter members; however it can be developed easily with the help of adding modules. 
3.	Some application area like deleting the record. 
So far as future scope of the project is concerned, firstly it is open to any modular expansion i.e. other modules or functions can be designed and embedded to handle the user need in future. Any part of the software and reports can be modified independently without much effort.
